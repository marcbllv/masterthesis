## Outline

### Methodology

**Two solutions** to assess the goodness of an explanation algorithm: 
- train a classifier, print explanations, remove most important explanations and observe the score reducing
- Better: create a bad classifier, print explanations, remove wrong data, retrain and see if score increases -- On 20 news groups

#### Algorithms 

Test it for Lime, treeinterpreter, linear models, Game theory (?), Parzen (?).
For Lime: test with various discretization methods.

####Â Datasets
- 20 newsgroup
- kaggle Ames housing market
- Boston Housing
- German credits

Comparison between treeinterpreter & lime ?
